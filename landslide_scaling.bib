	abstract = {Landslides have been observed in different terrestrial environments and also on planets, satellites, and asteroids. Long runout landslides are strongly dependent on the initial mass position, material and slope path properties, topographic relief, and presence of volatiles. Therefore, landslides represent a means for the description of rock properties and environment of deposition prevailing at the time of occurrence and may assist in understanding the geological and climatological history of the planetary surfaces. Concerning Mars, previous studies have concentrated on Valles Marineris, where among the largest and longest landslides have been observed. Using different imagery, we present and analyze an original database of 3,118 Martian landslides of deposit area greater than 0.1 km2 throughout the planet between 60°N and 60°S, resulting in a data set far richer than previously done. After a distinction is made between different typologies of landslides, their position and the statistical distribution of their geometrical properties are examined. Large landslides cluster along the Noctis Labyrinthus-Valles Marineris-Margaritifer Terra system. Rock avalanches within craters are widespread, but no significant large landslides have been found at latitudes higher than 40°S and 46°N. The magnitude-frequency distribution follows a power law with scaling exponent ranging between 1.02 and 1.57, for the entire data set and varies according to the geomorphological settings, the landslide typology, and mobility. A volume-area power law relationship (exponent: 1.12–1.24) is proposed, based on the reconstruction of 222 landslide geometries, and compared to those for similar terrestrial landslides (1.39). Similarities with respect to terrestrial landslide, distribution with respect to impact craters and impact energy, and cryosphere extent are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We examine 19 datasets with measurements of landslide volume, {VL}, for sub-aerial, submarine, and extraterrestrial mass movements. Individual datasets include from 17 to 1019 landslides of different types, including rock fall, rock slide, rock avalanche, soil slide, slide, and debris flow, with individual landslide volumes ranging over 10\&minus;4 m3\&le;{VL}\&le;1013 m3. We determine the probability density of landslide volumes, p({VL}), using kernel density estimation. Each landslide dataset exhibits heavy tailed (self-similar) behaviour for their frequency-size distributions, p({VL}) as a function of {VL}, for failures exceeding different threshold volumes, {VL}*, for each dataset. These non-cumulative heavy-tailed distributions for each dataset are negative power-laws, with exponents 1.0\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.9, and averaging \&beta;\&asymp;1.3. The scaling behaviour of {VL} for the ensemble of the 19 datasets is over 17 orders of magnitude, and is independent of lithological characteristics, morphological settings, triggering mechanisms, length of period and extent of the area covered by the datasets, presence or lack of water in the failed materials, and magnitude of gravitational fields. We argue that the statistics of landslide volume is conditioned primarily on the geometrical properties of the slope or rock mass where failures occur. Differences in the values of the scaling exponents reflect the primary landslide types, with rock falls exhibiting a smaller scaling exponent (1.1\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.4) than slides and soil slides (1.5\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.9). We argue that the difference is a consequence of the disparity in the mechanics of rock falls and slides.},

Through visual inspection of high-resolution imagery, we compiled an inventory of 60 landslides on the Moon and a second inventory of 58 landslides on Mercury. Adopting categories used to catalog terrestrial mass movements, we classiﬁed the landslides on the Moon and Mercury as rock slides. We determined the probability density distribution of their planimetric area, and we compared the distributions with similar distributions for terrestrial and martian landslides using data from the literature. We found that rock slides mapped in impact craters on the Moon are, on average, larger than analogous rock slides on Mercury. The relationship between the area of the individual rock slides and the area of the hosting crater suggests that rock slides on Mercury initiate in smaller craters. We hypothesize that the above ﬁndings are an effect of the weaker surface gravity of the Moon compared to that of Mercury and/or an effect of the rock material properties.},

	abstract = {Landslides are generally associated with a trigger, such as an earthquake, a rapid snowmelt or a large storm. The landslide event can include a single landslide or many thousands. The frequency–area (or volume) distribution of a landslide event quantiﬁes the number of landslides that occur at different sizes. We examine three well-documented landslide events, from Italy, Guatemala and the {USA}, each with a different triggering mechanism, and ﬁnd that the landslide areas for all three are well approximated by the same three-parameter inverse-gamma distribution. For small landslide areas this distribution has an exponential ‘roll-over’ and for medium and large landslide areas decays as a power-law with exponent −2·40. One implication of this landslide distribution is that the mean area of landslides in the distribution is independent of the size of the event. We also introduce a landslide-event magnitude scale {mL} = log({NLT}), with {NLT} the total number of landslides associated with a trigger. If a landslide-event inventory is incomplete (i.e. smaller landslides are not included), the partial inventory can be compared with our landslide probability distribution, and the corresponding landslide-event magnitude inferred. This technique can be applied to inventories of historical landslides, inferring the total number of landslides that occurred over geologic time, and how many of these have been erased by erosion, vegetation, and human activity. We have also considered three rockfall-dominated inventories, and ﬁnd that the frequency–size distributions differ substantially from those associated with other landslide types. We suggest that our proposed frequency–size distribution for landslides (excluding rockfalls) will be useful in quantifying the severity of landslide events and the contribution of landslides to erosion.

	abstract = {Landslide size distributions generally exhibit power‐law scaling over a limited scale range. The range is set by the mapping resolution, by the number of observed events, and by the slope failure process itself. This property of self‐similarity is an important insight into the physics of hillslope failure. Typically, however, a large proportion of the landslide data does not fit a simple power law. These data are always ignored in order to characterize the scaling. We show that landslide data sets from New Zealand and Taiwan exhibit two scaling regimes, separated by a crossover scale that is purely an artefact of mapping resolution. Below this scale the landslide data are undersampled. We propose a general model for the size distribution of observed landslides which can account for the whole population of mapped slope failures. The model quantifies the undersampling of smaller landslides and provides an improved estimation of the power‐law scaling of larger landslides. Estimates of this scaling suggest that the area disturbed by landsliding, and perhaps the landslide sediment yield, are essentially dependent on the frequency of smaller landslides. Higher resolution landslide maps will be required in order to quantify these fluxes. Our results also indicate that the probability of extreme landslide events is less than previous studies would predict.},

As terrestrial long runout landslides emplaced on glaciers commonly exhibit longitudinal ridges, the presence of these landforms has been used to infer the presence of ice on Mars, where hundreds of well-preserved long runout landslides with longitudinal ridges are found. However, the presence of the same landforms in regions where extensive glaciations did not occur, for instance, on the Moon and in the Atacama region on Earth, suggests that ice is not the only factor influencing the formation of long runout landslides with longitudinal ridges.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Iceland is a unique region for its high spatial density of well-preserved hypermobile large landslides with longitudinal ridges.

	abstract = {We have analyzed mass wasting features, their distribution and deposit geometry on the two largest main asteroid belt objects—protoplanet Vesta and dwarf planet Ceres—and compared their geomorphology and mobility. Both asteroids have similar surface accelerations, but different surface compositions. Based on our observations and previous studies, we categorized three distinct morphological mass wasting classes: slumps, slides, and flow-like movements. We conclude that Ceres has abundant features of flow-like mass movements. Further, sliding and flow-like characteristics are identified in craters within mid-latitudes which supports the possibility of the presence of water ice in the near subsurface of Ceres. Vesta predominantly shows characteristics of dry granular-like slide features which are distributed homogenously across the surface. By plotting the ratio between fall height (H) and run-out length (L) (effective coefficient of friction, H/L) against the run-out length and spreading width (W), we demonstrate that deposits on Vesta terminate on shorter distances, whereas on Ceres they travel longer distances. The deposit geometry and the similar surface gravity on both asteroids suggest that the material composition and volatile component have a significant effect on deposit emplacement. However, both bodies’ mass movements have similar effective coefficients of friction, even though Vesta's regolith is comparatively dry, whereas Ceres is rich in water ice. This leads to the conclusion that volatile content alone cannot be responsible for low effective coefficients of friction, and that more than one geological process is needed to explain the mass motion behavior and morphology.},

Our simulations indicate that long runout landslides on Ceres do not require the presence of fluid or slippery ice to explain their mobility. We find that lower fall heights and larger volumes lead to increased slide mobility while the relatively low surface gravity of Ceres, compared to the Earth and Mars, reduces slide mobility and affects slide morphology. We show that latitudinal trends in number of slides and slide morphology are more consistent with trends in topography than expected trends in near-surface ice content. These morphological trends with topography are also consistent with the results of our landslide simulations. We argue that landslide morphology cannot be used to draw conclusions about local ice content and composition. However, the higher abundance of long runout landslides on Ceres relative to Vesta may be related to its higher global ice content or greater endogenic activity.},
