	abstract = {Landslides have been observed in different terrestrial environments and also on planets, satellites, and asteroids. Long runout landslides are strongly dependent on the initial mass position, material and slope path properties, topographic relief, and presence of volatiles. Therefore, landslides represent a means for the description of rock properties and environment of deposition prevailing at the time of occurrence and may assist in understanding the geological and climatological history of the planetary surfaces. Concerning Mars, previous studies have concentrated on Valles Marineris, where among the largest and longest landslides have been observed. Using different imagery, we present and analyze an original database of 3,118 Martian landslides of deposit area greater than 0.1 km2 throughout the planet between 60°N and 60°S, resulting in a data set far richer than previously done. After a distinction is made between different typologies of landslides, their position and the statistical distribution of their geometrical properties are examined. Large landslides cluster along the Noctis Labyrinthus-Valles Marineris-Margaritifer Terra system. Rock avalanches within craters are widespread, but no significant large landslides have been found at latitudes higher than 40°S and 46°N. The magnitude-frequency distribution follows a power law with scaling exponent ranging between 1.02 and 1.57, for the entire data set and varies according to the geomorphological settings, the landslide typology, and mobility. A volume-area power law relationship (exponent: 1.12–1.24) is proposed, based on the reconstruction of 222 landslide geometries, and compared to those for similar terrestrial landslides (1.39). Similarities with respect to terrestrial landslide, distribution with respect to impact craters and impact energy, and cryosphere extent are also discussed.},

	abstract = {We examine 19 datasets with measurements of landslide volume, {VL}, for sub-aerial, submarine, and extraterrestrial mass movements. Individual datasets include from 17 to 1019 landslides of different types, including rock fall, rock slide, rock avalanche, soil slide, slide, and debris flow, with individual landslide volumes ranging over 10\&minus;4 m3\&le;{VL}\&le;1013 m3. We determine the probability density of landslide volumes, p({VL}), using kernel density estimation. Each landslide dataset exhibits heavy tailed (self-similar) behaviour for their frequency-size distributions, p({VL}) as a function of {VL}, for failures exceeding different threshold volumes, {VL}*, for each dataset. These non-cumulative heavy-tailed distributions for each dataset are negative power-laws, with exponents 1.0\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.9, and averaging \&beta;\&asymp;1.3. The scaling behaviour of {VL} for the ensemble of the 19 datasets is over 17 orders of magnitude, and is independent of lithological characteristics, morphological settings, triggering mechanisms, length of period and extent of the area covered by the datasets, presence or lack of water in the failed materials, and magnitude of gravitational fields. We argue that the statistics of landslide volume is conditioned primarily on the geometrical properties of the slope or rock mass where failures occur. Differences in the values of the scaling exponents reflect the primary landslide types, with rock falls exhibiting a smaller scaling exponent (1.1\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.4) than slides and soil slides (1.5\&le;\&beta;\&le;1.9). We argue that the difference is a consequence of the disparity in the mechanics of rock falls and slides.},

	abstract = {Impact craters are the most common surface features on the Moon and Mercury. On these two bodies, we recognized and mapped large landslides on the walls of impact craters. Through visual inspection of high-resolution imagery, we compiled an inventory of 60 landslides on the Moon and a second inventory of 58 landslides on Mercury. Adopting categories used to catalog terrestrial mass movements, we classiﬁed the landslides on the Moon and Mercury as rock slides. We determined the probability density distribution of their planimetric area, and we compared the distributions with similar distributions for terrestrial and martian landslides using data from the literature. We found that rock slides mapped in impact craters on the Moon are, on average, larger than analogous rock slides on Mercury. The relationship between the area of the individual rock slides and the area of the hosting crater suggests that rock slides on Mercury initiate in smaller craters. We hypothesize that the above ﬁndings are an effect of the weaker surface gravity of the Moon compared to that of Mercury and/or an effect of the rock material properties.},

	abstract = {Landslides are generally associated with a trigger, such as an earthquake, a rapid snowmelt or a large storm. The landslide event can include a single landslide or many thousands. The frequency–area (or volume) distribution of a landslide event quantiﬁes the number of landslides that occur at different sizes. We examine three well-documented landslide events, from Italy, Guatemala and the {USA}, each with a different triggering mechanism, and ﬁnd that the landslide areas for all three are well approximated by the same three-parameter inverse-gamma distribution. For small landslide areas this distribution has an exponential ‘roll-over’ and for medium and large landslide areas decays as a power-law with exponent −2·40. One implication of this landslide distribution is that the mean area of landslides in the distribution is independent of the size of the event. We also introduce a landslide-event magnitude scale {mL} = log({NLT}), with {NLT} the total number of landslides associated with a trigger. If a landslide-event inventory is incomplete (i.e. smaller landslides are not included), the partial inventory can be compared with our landslide probability distribution, and the corresponding landslide-event magnitude inferred. This technique can be applied to inventories of historical landslides, inferring the total number of landslides that occurred over geologic time, and how many of these have been erased by erosion, vegetation, and human activity. We have also considered three rockfall-dominated inventories, and ﬁnd that the frequency–size distributions differ substantially from those associated with other landslide types. We suggest that our proposed frequency–size distribution for landslides (excluding rockfalls) will be useful in quantifying the severity of landslide events and the contribution of landslides to erosion.
